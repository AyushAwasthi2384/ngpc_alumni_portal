            I did BA(in psychology)from NPGC as we all know that people do not give much importance to courses like BA
            but this college gives us all the deserved importance. During 3rd semester of my college life, I did an
            internship in the psychology department.

            I studied BCA at National P.G. College and through the course of time, I learned various programming
            languages like python, java etc that are necessary for my field to get a job in the IT industry. The
            teachers are well-versed with their subjects and they made learning tough programming language easy for us.
